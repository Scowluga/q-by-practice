# 12 Days of Xmas
From https://code.kx.com/q/learn/pb/xmas-days/. This problem deals with iteration.

My solutions, in the order I did them:
- `and_after_turtle_doves.q` the simplest solution, we stick the "and" after the turtle doves line.
- `and_before_partridge.q` more difficult, uses a conditional to specify "And a partridge..." or "A partridge...".
- `scalar_general.q` a general solution based on specifying a stanza, and building verses via indices.
- `scalar.q` a specialized modification of the general scalar solution. Uses only two lines.
