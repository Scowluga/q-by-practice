# [12 Days of Xmas](https://code.kx.com/q/learn/pb/xmas-days/)
Teaches iteration and list modification (apply at).

My solutions:
- `and_after_turtle_doves.q` the simplest solution, we stick the "and" after the turtle doves line.
- `and_before_partridge.q` more difficult, uses a conditional to specify "And a partridge..." or "A partridge...".
- `scalar_general.q` a general solution based on specifying a stanza, and building verses via indices.
- `scalar.q` a specialized modification of the general scalar solution. Uses only two lines.
