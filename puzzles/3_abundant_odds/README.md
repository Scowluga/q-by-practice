# [Abundant Odds](https://code.kx.com/q/learn/pb/abundant-odds/)
Teachers iterators and accumulators.

My solutions:
- `nxt.q` use a `nxt` function that returns the next abundant odd number. Combine `nxt` with accumulators to get output.
- `nxt_pair.q` have `nxt` return not just the number, but also its sum of divisors to avoid recomputation for display.
- `filter.q` TODO
