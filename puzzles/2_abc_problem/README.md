# [ABC Problem](https://code.kx.com/q/learn/pb/abc-problem/)
Teaches recursion and backtracking.

My solutions:
- `backtrack_exhaustive.q` basic backtracking that exhaustively checks all valid solutions.
- `backtrack_stopping.q` includes early stopping after a successful solution is found (3x faster in stress test).
