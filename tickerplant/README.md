# Tickerplant
This directory provides a highly-simplified mock real-time tickerplant and data processing system for my personal study.

## Resources
The code originates from the Kx open-source example:
- https://code.kx.com/q/learn/startingkdb/tick/
- https://github.com/KxSystems/kdb-tick
- https://github.com/KxSystems/cookbook/tree/master/start/tick

The majority of the original code has been refactored, simplified, or removed. 
Many significant features have also been added.

## Installation & Start Up
On a Macbook Pro running Big Sur 11.5.2:
- Install q with the on-demand license in the default location `~/q`. 
  Otherwise, change `run.applescript` as necessary.
- Clone the repo into the default directory `~/q/q-by-practice`.
- Follow the cookbook requirement: Terminal > Preferences > New tabs open with > set to default.
- Run `run.applescript`.

## Architecture
