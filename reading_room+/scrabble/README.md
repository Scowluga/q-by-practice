# [Scrabble](https://code.kx.com/q/learn/reading/scrabble/)
As an amateur Scrabble player, I really enjoyed this example. I've extended it to support features I would personally
like to use given a copy of a real Scrabble word list (I use Collins):
- `bingo` method now returns valid words of length 7.
- TODO: both `by_score` and `bingo` functions now take wildcard `"_"` characters representing blanks.
