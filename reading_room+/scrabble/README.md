As an amateur Scrabble player, I really enjoyed this example. I've extended it to support features I would personally
like to use given a copy of a real Scrabble word list (I use Collins):
- New `bingo` method returning valid words of length 7.
- Support for the `"_"` wildcard character representing a blank.
